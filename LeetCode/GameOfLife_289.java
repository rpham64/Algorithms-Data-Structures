 * 
 * According to the Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, 
 * also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised 
 * by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."
 * 
 * Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an initial 
 * state live (1) or dead (0). Each cell interacts with its 
 * eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the 
 * following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):
 * 
 * 1) Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, 
 * as if caused by under-population.
 * 
 * 2) Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives 
 * on to the next generation.
 * 
 * 3) Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, 
 * as if by over-population..
 * 
 * 4) Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes 
 * a live cell, as if by reproduction.
 * 
 * Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) 
 * of the board given its current state.
 * 
 * Follow up: 
 * 
 * - Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs 
 * to be updated at the same time: You cannot update some cells 
 * first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
 * 
 * - In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. 
 * In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems 
 * when the active area encroaches the border of the array. How would 
 * you address these problems?
