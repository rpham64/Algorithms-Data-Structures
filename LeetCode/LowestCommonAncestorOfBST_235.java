/**
 * Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) 
 * of two given nodes in the BST.
 * 
 * According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor 
 * is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both 
 * v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
 * 
 * Solution: http://www.fusu.us/2013/06/p2-lowest-common-ancestor-in-binary-tree.html
